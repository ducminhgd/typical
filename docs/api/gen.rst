``typical`` Gen API
===================
``typical``'s efficiency is powered by generated code. At run-time, decorated and
contrained classes generate finely-tuned code specifically for the type. It's not
recommended to use this API directly, as it could be changed or removed at any time.
This documentation is provided for the sake of completion.
